      <hr />
      <p>
        Pixel Jam is open to anyone who wants to test their mettle by getting
        just a weekend to put together a whole video game. You can enter as an
        individual or as a team, and you'll need be able to build the design,
        code and art all in the 48 hours you're given.
      </p>
      <p>
        The competition begins at 6:00 PM on Friday the 12<sup>th</sup> of
        September at Victoria University in Wellington, and will end at 6:00 PM
        the following Sunday. There'll be a common theme that everyone has to
        build their game around, but otherwise there's no limits to what you can
        make: 2D, 3D, FPS or RPG, it's all open.
      </p>
      <p>
        There'll be an entry fee of $30, and we supply T-shirts and some food.
        And there are prizes up for grabs! With judges from the local game
        development industry it's also a great way to get yourself out there and
        get recognised.
      </p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>How much can we prepare beforehand?</h3>
          <p>
            You can use existing frameworks, development tools and even your own
            libraries. The main thing is that all the code and artwork specific
            to the actual game are produced during the event.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Do we need to bring our own hardware?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, you'll need to bring your own computers and any other equipment
            you want to use. You can safely leave this equipment at the venue
            overnight. We'll supply power and internet.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Can we come with a game idea already in mind?</h3>
          <p>
            We're not opposed to this, but it'd be great if everyone opened with
            a game design session. The theme is there in part to counter you
            bringing a detailed design with you, but a general idea of what you
            want to make isn't a bad thing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Do we have 24/7 access to the venue? Are we allowed to leave?</h3>
          <p>
            We're still working this out. It looks like we may be able to run
            overnight access, but we may have to restrict access to leaving and
            arriving during the night.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What's with the fee? Is it per person or per team?</h3>
          <p>
            The fee is per person, to pay for the shirts and food. Bring it with
            you to the event and we'll get it off you once we hand out the
            shirts.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Where is it, exactly?</h3>
          <p>
            On the first floor of the Alan MacDiarmid (AM) building at the VUW
            Kelburn campus. You can find it near the corner of Kelburn Parade
            and Glasgow Street, with a Wishbone by the entrance.
            <a href='http://www.victoria.ac.nz/about/explore-victoria/campuses/kelburn/kelburn-campus-map.pdf'>
            This map</a> should help you find it. We'll have signs up to direct
            you to the room once you're there.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Is there parking available?</h3>
          <p>
            Parking is available over the weekend.
